    				<p>We offer programs for children ranging from 18 months to school age. Our qualified teachers and assistants offer activities that develop self-esteem, confidence, sharing, and problem-solving skills, and maintain a continual 1:5 or 1:8 adult/child ratio, depending on the child’s age. Activities, play centres, story time, and crafts focus around the children’s interests (such as farms, dinosaurs, numbers, colours, shapes, nutrition and special holidays for example).</p>

    				<h2 class="mb-4">Toddlers</h2>
    				<p>Between 18 to 30 months, children are meeting new challenges as fast as they come. Children learn best if they are in a stimulating environment. Music, stories, outdoor play, and learning simplicities envelop much of the day. Our caregivers are dedicated in helping each child develop these skills through a trusting and loving relationship. A parental daily report is given to update each family on meal times, nap times, toilet training and activities accomplished each day. One room is available to cater to this age group with a 1:5 adult to child ratio.</p>

    				<h2 class="mb-4">Preschoolers</h2>
    				<p>Between 30 months to 5 years, children continue to learn and practice new skills. Language, socialization and a variety of disciplines such as reading, science, technology, engineering, art & mathematics are fundamentals which children are starting to learn the fundamentals. These areas will allow children to have a head start as they prepare for kindergarten. Our teachers and assistants are dedicated in helping each child develop and master skills. A parental daily report is given to update each family on meal times, nap times, toilet training and activities accomplished each day. Two rooms are available to cater to this age group with a 1:8 adult to child ratio..</p>

            <h2 class="mb-4">School Age</h2>
            <p>As children get older and more independent, they need new challenges. That’s why we offer a school-age program for before and after school care and enrichment programs that address the changing and more varied needs of growing school-age children. Reading, math, and science activities ensure that your child's mind is engaged and help create a lifelong love of learning and exploration.</p>

    				<h2 class="mb-4">At Our Day Care Center</h2>
    				<p>Each day starts with free play where children choose from various activities, toys, and different play centres. The children then move to the Flex Room where they are encouraged to express themselves artistically through the use of creative art supplies. Different art resources are rotated regularly depending on the children’s interests. Following this, the children enjoy a nutritious snack, story time, and circle time with songs, discussions, finger-plays, and games. In the final part of the morning the children develop gross motor skills. The children play outdoors using safe and clean playground equipment, a sandbox, tricycles, hoops, and balls. During inclement weather, the children play indoors in the Flex Room. Children then come inside for a delicious and nutritious lunch if they are full day or for dismissal if they are half day.<br>

                        In the afternoon, the children are encouraged to have free play once again with a variety of play centres showcasing different learning opportunities and then a nap for those who require it (quite activities for those who choose not to nap). This is followed by circle time with a book and songs and then outdoor play. We visit the Flex Room to engage in creative play and then return for an afternoon snack. Quiet activities are scheduled inside, followed by music and drama time and then a final round of free play prior to children being picked up.<br>
                        
                        During all of our classes, the children:<br>
➢ Explore their creativity through imaginary play and artwork<br>
➢ Develop their attention spans and listening skills<br>
➢ Learn to take turns and participate in a group setting<br>
➢ Develop social skills and manners<br>
➢ Experience the value and joy of reading and music<br>
➢ Participate in learning the basics of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art & mathematics)

                    <h2 class="mb-4">Date Night</h2>
                    <p>Friday and Saturday evenings between 6pm to 11pm are available for children who are 3 years of age and older. The evenings start with dinner or snack whatever is selected followed by indoor free play. Next is outdoor and active play. The group then comes back indoors for circle time activities which consist of bed time stories and songs. Washroom routines follow and children change into favourite cozy pyjamas. Most children go to bed and those who choose not to, engage in quiet activities. Gradual departure of children begins while children are either sleeping or quietly playing. These nights are great for a date night, extended shift work hours or events where you can’t bring your child.</p>
